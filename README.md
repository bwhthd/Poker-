#Poker Hand
Here is a small program that will determine the hand delt to a player in poker. It is written in Python. It was inspired by an interview question. See Pokerhand.py for the program that actually determines the hand delt to the player. 

##Continuation
I am currently also trying to learn a little bit of ruby. I may get around to rewriting this in ruby, and possibly creating a django or rails app for a poker game.
